# btx sync

A cross-platform desktop application for synchronizing content from Braze to Transifex for translation. This tool allows non-technical users to easily pull content from Braze, upload it to Transifex, and manage translation workflows with a simple graphical user interface (GUI).

## Features

-   **Braze Content Extraction:** Fetches Email Templates and Content Blocks directly from the Braze API.
-   **Transifex Integration:** Creates a unique resource in Transifex for each Braze item, using the Braze ID as a stable slug and the Braze name as the human-readable resource name.
-   **TMX Backup:** Automatically performs a backup of your project's entire Translation Memory (TMX) file from Transifex before syncing, as a safety measure.
-   **Secure Credential Storage:** Uses the native OS keychain (`keyring`) to securely store your Braze and Transifex API keys. No sensitive information is stored in plaintext files.
-   **User-Friendly GUI:** A simple interface built with CustomTkinter for easy operation, with helpers and pop-ups to guide users.
-   **Configurable Settings:** An easy-to-use settings panel for configuring API keys, endpoints, and features like TMX backup.
-   **Robust Logging:** Provides clear feedback on the sync process, with an optional "Debug" mode for detailed API call inspection.
